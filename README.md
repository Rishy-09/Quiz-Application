## Introduction

Welcome to the **Quiz Application**! This Java-based project is designed for managing quizzes with features for user login, quiz handling, rules enforcement, and score tracking. It utilizes Java Swing for a rich graphical user interface (GUI) and is structured to support various quiz functionalities.

## Project Structure üóÇÔ∏è

The project is organized into two main folders:

1. **`quiz.application`**: Contains Java classes:
    - **`Login`**: Handles user authentication and login processes.
    - **`Quiz`**: Manages quiz questions and answers.
    - **`Rules`**: Enforces the rules and guidelines for the quiz.
    - **`Score`**: Manages and displays quiz scores.

2. **`Icons`**: Contains JPEG and PNG files used in the application's GUI.

## API Reference üìú

The application requires the following imports:
```java
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
```
## Prerequisites üîß

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 21**: Make sure Java JDK 21 is installed on your machine.


- **IDE**: Use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or any other Java-compatible IDE.


- **MySQL Workbench**: If the project requires database operations, ensure MySQL Workbench is installed and set up.
